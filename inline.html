  <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique
    called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food
    (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
    set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In
    his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-
    low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
  <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.
      To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30.</time></P>

    it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p>
